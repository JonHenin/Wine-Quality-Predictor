## Wine Quality Predictor

## Project Description
In this project we use data from a study by P. Cortez (et al.) which is a dataset of 11 physicochemical properties of red and white wines.  Each wine is then given a value score from 0-10.  We converted this analysis to a binary classification where =<6 is bad and >6 is good.  We ran the data through GridSearchCV with 3 different models, with and without PCA, for a total of 6 different methods.
